Overview of the Project

Project: To-Do List Web Application

Objective This To-Do List web application was developed during my internship at CodeTech Solutions. The primary objective of this project is to streamline task management through a simple and intuitive user interface. Users can effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring efficient organization of their to-dos.

Features Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button. Edit Tasks: Directly edit task names within the list for quick modifications. Delete Tasks: Remove tasks individually or in bulk with a single click.

Technologies Used HTML: Provides the structure for the web application. CSS: Styles the application with a clean and modern design. JavaScript: Implements the interactive functionalities, such as adding, editing, deleting, and saving tasks.

Development Details Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). Local Storage: Utilizes browser's local storage to save tasks persistently, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

Usage Add a Task: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button. Edit a Task: Click on the task name to enable editing. After making changes, click the "Save" button to update the task. Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

Due Dates and Reminders: Enable users to set due dates and receive notifications for upcoming tasks. Category Tags: Provide options to categorize tasks using tags for better organization. Cloud Storage Integration: Sync tasks across devices using cloud storage solutions.
